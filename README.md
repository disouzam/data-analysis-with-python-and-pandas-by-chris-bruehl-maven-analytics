# About

This repository will contain solution to exercises and exploration code related to LinkedIn Learning course made by [Chris Bruehl](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisbruehl/) from [Maven Analytics](https://mavenanalytics.io/), available at [Data Analysis with Python and Pandas](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/data-analysis-with-python-and-pandas)

# Dependency management

For dependency management, Poetry will be the tool selected due to its ease of configuration and flexible use cases (either for package creation or for just providing environment management for notebooks).

The first libraries installed to this repository were the following ones:

- numpy: https://numpy.org/
- pandas: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html
- marimo: https://marimo.app/
- prek: 
    - https://github.com/j178/prek?tab=readme-ov-file#installation
    - https://prek.j178.dev/quickstart/
    - https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks

Numpy and Pandas were added as they are the center of this course content. Marimo was selected as the notebook of choice - reactive, beautiful and helpful UI, notebook/script quick switch possible - and prek as a pre-commit tool to keep a unified code styling.
